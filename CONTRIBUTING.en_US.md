## I am good at translation!

Ah, that is great! You can help me translate the plugin to other languages!

Please do this:

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new branch in your fork repository called `<your username>-lang`, which should be checked out from the `main` branch.
3. According to the [Language code table](http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm), create the corresponding language file in the src\main\resources\lang directory of the project, and the naming format is `<language code>.json`, but you need to replace the `-` in the language code with `_`. For example, the language file for Japanese should be `ja_JP.json`, not `ja-JP.json`.
4. Translate the strings into the language you will submit based on any existing language files (any language you already know is fine, Chinese is recommended).
5. After the translation is complete, send me a Pull Request!

## I am good at coding!

Please do this:

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new branch in your fork repository called `<your username>-code`, which should be checked out from the `main` branch.
3. Modify the plugin source code!
4. When done, send me a Pull Request!
